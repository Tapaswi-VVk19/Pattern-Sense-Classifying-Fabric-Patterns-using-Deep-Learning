## Introduction

Pattern Sense is a project designed to automate the process of identifying and categorizing fabric patterns using advanced deep learning techniques. This system can be used in various industries such as fashion, textiles, and interior design to streamline pattern recognition tasks. The goal is to reduce manual errors and improve the efficiency of pattern classification.

---

## Ideation Phase

The inspiration behind Pattern Sense originated from the need to ease the manual categorization of fabric patterns. Recognizing that manual classification is slow and prone to inconsistencies, the project leverages deep learning models to:
- Automatically classify diverse fabric patterns (e.g., stripes, polka dots, floral, geometric)
- Enhance productivity in industries like fashion and quality control in textiles
- Provide scalable and efficient solutions using state-of-the-art neural networks

## Requirements Analysis

To build and deploy Pattern Sense, the following skills and technologies are required:
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** TensorFlow (or any similar deep learning framework)
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques to prepare, augment, and normalize fabric pattern images
- **Tools:** Git for version control, data visualization libraries, etc.
- **Domain Knowledge:** Understanding of fabric patterns and quality control measures

---

## Project Design

The system is designed around a few key components:
- **Data Pipeline:** For collecting and preprocessing a comprehensive dataset of fabric patterns.
- **Deep Learning Model:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns to classify patterns from the dataset.
- **User Interface:** (Optional) An interface that allows users to upload images and view classification results.
- **Feedback Loop:** For refining the model based on real-world input and improving accuracy over time.

## Project Planning and Schedule

A high-level breakdown of the project phases is as follows:
1. **Dataset Collection and Labeling (Week 1-2):** Gather and label fabric images for training.
2. **Data Preprocessing and Augmentation (Week 3):** Enhance dataset quality and variability through augmentation.
3. **Model Building and Training (Week 4-5):** Develop and train the CNN model.
4. **Model Evaluation and Tuning (Week 6):** Perform validations, tweak hyperparameters, and improve performance.
5. **Deployment and Integration (Week 7):** Integrate the model with an application interface.
6. **Final Testing and Documentation (Week 8):** Conduct thorough testing and compile documentation.

## Functional and Performance Testing

The project emphasizes both functional and performance testing:
- **Functional Testing:** Ensures the model correctly classifies known fabric patterns. It includes integration testing with the application interface.
- **Performance Testing:** Evaluates the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on unseen test data. Performance tests also validate the system's scalability and robustness.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** Organize your fabric image dataset and place it in the required directory.
2. **Training:** Run the training script (`train_model.py`) to build and train the model.
3. **Inference:** Use the provided interface or inference scripts to classify new fabric pattern images.
4. **Continuous Improvement:** Fine-tune the model by incorporating new data and feedback from real-world usage.

Example command to run the model training:
```bash
python train_model.py
